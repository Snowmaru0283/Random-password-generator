# Random-password-generator
Hello! This is a simple project i made to learn more about Java. A completely random password generator.
This simple program lets you:

1) ğŸ”¢ Choose a password length
2) ğŸ”¤ Generate a random password with only alphabet characters
3) ğŸ”£ Generate a random password with special characters
4) ğŸ”¢ Generate a random pin 
5) ğŸ”€ Shuffle previously generated password
6) (Extra) Shuffle a password by input

I hope you enjoy this little program! (or maybe not) 
PS: It doesn't have exception handler :c
